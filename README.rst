==============================
Django CMS Contact Form Plugin
==============================

Contact form plugin for `Django CMS <http://www.django-cms.org/>`_ with spam protection and i18n.

Spam protection is done through `glamkit-stopspam <http://github.com/maccesch/glamkit-stopspam>`_ which provides three different protection methods.

If you want to use ReCAPTCHA you have to get a Public and Private Key from http://www.google.com/recaptcha. You can get them for free.

The Akismet spam protection method requires an Akismet API Key which is obtainable from http://akismet.com/ For private persons this is free, too.

For more Information on the spam protection methods see the glamkit-stopspam link below.
